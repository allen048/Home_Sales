# Home_Sales

For this challenge, I used Google Colaboratory to write and execute the SparkSQL code. The code involved determining an understanding of executing key metrics for home sales. I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.
